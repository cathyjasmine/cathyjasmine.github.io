Education
======
* 2022-Now Ph.D. student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

  University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712

* 2019-2022 M.S. in Computer Science and Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. Majoring in computer vision, advised by [Prof. Li Niu](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/niuli/) and [Prof.Liqing Zhang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=67) in [BCMI](http://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn) lab.

* 2015-2019 B.S. in Computer Science and Technology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. Majoring in computer science and technology.


Research Experience
======
* **Deep Image Unfolding in the Wild**: On-going work on wide-range image blending with reference guidance; enabled novel and diverse content generation in the intermediate region.
* **Deep Video Harmonization**: Leveraged color mapping consistency to lift the burden of establishing spatial correspondence; achieved ~15% improvement than the strongest baseline with higher temporal consistency.
* **Video Harmonization Dataset Construction**: Constructed and released the first public video harmonization dataset [HYouTube](https://github.com/bcmi/Video-Harmonization-Dataset-HYouTube) which contains 3194 pairs of synthetic composite videos and real videos. 
* **High-Resolution Image Harmonization**: Combined complementary traditional RGB-to-RGB transformation and deep pixel-to-pixel transformation in an end-to-end framework; achieved ~50% improvement and saved ~65% time and computational resources.
* **Cross-Domain Image Harmonization**: Designed the first cross-domain image harmonization network using the mixture of rendered images and real images; achieved ~34% improvement on novel categories.
* **Rendered Human Harmonization Dataset Construction**: Constructed and released the first large-scale rendered harmonization dataset [RHHarmony](https://github.com/bcmi/Rendered_Image_Harmonization_Datasets) with 135k image pairs; mitigated the labor-intensive dataset extension.
* **Background-Guided Image Harmonization [[code](https://github.com/bcmi/BargainNet)]**: Formulated image harmonization as background guided domain translation task; enabled the prediction of inharmony level of composite images using domain code; achieved new state-of-the-art: ~21% improvements than the strongest baseline.
* **Image Harmonization via Domain Verification [[code](https://github.com/bcmi/Image_Harmonization_Datasets)]**: Designed a domain verification discriminator to pull close the foreground domain and background domain; achieved state-of-the-art performance: ~31% improvements than the strongest baseline; provided the first benchmark in image harmonization field.
* **Image Harmonization Dataset Construction**: Constructed and released the first large-scale image harmonization dataset [iHarmony4](https://github.com/bcmi/Image_Harmonization_Datasets) with 4 sub-datasets (HCOCO, HAdobe5k, HFlickr, and Hday2night) and 73146 pairs of high-quality images.


Work Experience
======

* **Research Intern in [ZMO.AI](https://www.zmo.ai/zh/about-us/) (startup)**
  - Collaborated with upstream pose search, image inpainting, image matting, and image composition techniques and developed an efficient background harmonization network for real-time background replacement.
  - Achieved excellent results on both indoor and outdoor backgrounds for on-model images; Applied to the practical application of content generation for e-commerce brands.

* **Research Intern in Hisense Co., Ltd (School-enterprise cooperation).**
  - Turned recent research in deep image harmonization into revenue; achieved high-quality, high-resolution, and high-fps harmonization and carried it through Hisense's devices; made three relevant patents available.


* **Teaching Assistant in SJTU**
  - *CS245: Principles of Data Science* for undergraduates, 2020 Spring.
  - *CS7335: Statistical Learning and Inference* for postgraduates, 2020 Fall. 
  - *CS245: Principles of Data Science* for undergraduates, 2021 Spring.

* **School Counselor of Campus Life Management Department in SJTU**
	- Responsible for the management of 92 life guidance teachers and 23 teacher studios  and organized more than 40 cultural and sports activities including New Year Gifts, Assessment of Standardized Dormitory, etc..
