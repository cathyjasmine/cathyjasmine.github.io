* I am currently a final-year master student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/) of Shanghai Jiao Tong University ([SJTU](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/)) in China.
* My research interests cover Computer Vision and Deep Learning. More specifically, I focus mainly on Image Harmonization. 
* Prior to now, I obtained my  bachelor degree majoring in computer science and technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in China.

# Recent news
* Apr, 2021. We release the first large-scale rendered image harmonization dataset RHHarmony at [GitHub](https://github.com/bcmi/Rendered_Image_Harmonization_Datasets) which contains 135k pairs of ground-truth rendered images and composite rendered images.
* Apr, 2021. We release the source code and trained models of our BargainNet at [GitHub](https://github.com/bcmi/BargainNet). In addition, to facilitate future study of image harmonization, we summarize image harmonization related methods at [Awesome-Image-Harmonization](https://github.com/bcmi/Awesome-Image-Harmonization) and provide the quantitative comparison of different baselines on iHarmony4 dataset at [GitHub](https://github.com/bcmi/Image_Harmonization_Datasets/).
* Mar, 2021. My paper "BargainNet: Background-Guided Domain Translation for Image Harmonization" is accepted by **ICME2021** as **Oral**.
* Oct, 2020. I win the **National Scholarship for Graduate Students** (Top 0.2% Nationwide).
* Mar, 2020. We release the source code and trained models of our DoveNet and other baselines  at [GitHub](https://github.com/bcmi/Image_Harmonization_Datasets/).
* Feb, 2020. My paper "DoveNet: Deep Image Harmonization via Domain Verification" is accepted by **CVPR2020**.
* Nov, 2019. I win the second prize in "HUAWEI Cup" The 16th China Post-Graduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling.
* Aug, 2019. We release the first synthesized image harmonization dataset **iHarmony4** at [GitHub](https://github.com/bcmi/Image_Harmonization_Datasets/), which contains four sub-datasets: HCOCO, HAdobe5k, HFlickr, Hday2night, with a total of 73,146 pairs of unharmonized images and harmonized images.
