# Recent news
* Dec.2019. I start my new project on the early-stage resource and timing predictor in HLS-level for FPGA emulation system. This is one part of my graduation project about FPGA design space exploration.
* Nov.2019. I receive the Hongyi Scholarship ￥25,000 for excellent academic and research performance (only 10 students in SJTU).
* Nov.2019. My co-authored paper "ROQ: A Noise-Aware Quantization Scheme Towards Robust Optical Neural Networks with Low-bit Controls" is accepted by DATE 2020!
* Sep.2019. I finish my internship at [UTDA](https://www.cerc.utexas.edu/utda/). In my independent project, a parallel graph partitioning solver now outperforms the state-of-art graph partition tool Metis ~5% at cut-size. A CUDA version and a parallel version were implemented to accelerate my code. Thanks to Prof. David Pan's help during this summer!
* Jun.2019. I start my internship at [UTDA](https://www.cerc.utexas.edu/utda/), working with [Prof.David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/david-z-pan), IEEE & SPIE fellow.
* May.2019. One co-authored paper was submitted to the Journal of Shanghai Jiao Tong University about wireless antenna design for the areospace engine. This journal is indexed by EI.
* Jan.2019. Thank Fontile Education Fund for the <font color="#dd0000"> Outstanding Undergraduate Student Scholarship</font>
 ￥30,000 for excellent academic performance (only 5 undergraduate students in our university)!
