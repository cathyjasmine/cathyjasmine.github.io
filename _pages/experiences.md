  - Research Intern, Jan. 2021 - Apr. 2021, Shenzhen, China
  - Realistic and real-time background replacement for on-model images, used for content generation for e-commerce brands.

* **Hisense Group Holdings Co., Ltd., China**
  - Research Intern, Dec. 2020 - May 2021, Qingdao, CHina
  - High-quality, high-resolution, and high-fps harmonization on Hisense's virtual household devices; held three relevant patents.

Research Experience
------
* University of Texas at Austin, USA
	Research Assistant, ECE department, Jun. 2021 - Dec. 2021
	* **Object-Centric Image Unfolding**: On-going work on a new challenging task.

* Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China
	Research Assistant, CS department, Dec. 2018 - Mar. 2022
	* **High-Resolution Image Harmonization [[code](https://github.com/bcmi/CDTNet-High-Resolution-Image-Harmonization)]**: Proposed the first high-resolution image harmonization network with collaborative dual transformations: high-resolution traditional color transformation and low-resolution deep pixel transformation; achieved ~50% improvement and saved ~65% time and computational resources.
	* **Cross-Domain Image Harmonization  [[code](https://github.com/bcmi/Rendered-Image-Harmonization-Dataset-RHHarmony)]**: Proposed the first cross-domain image harmonization network using the mixture of rendered images and real images; achieved ~35% improvement on novel categories.
	* **Rendered Human Harmonization Dataset Construction**: Released the first large-scale rendered image harmonization dataset [RHHarmony](https://github.com/bcmi/Rendered_Image_Harmonization_Datasets) with 135k image pairs; mitigated labor-intensive extension and supplemented real datasets.
	* **Deep Video Harmonization  [[code](https://github.com/bcmi/Video-Harmonization-Dataset-HYouTube)]**: Leveraged color mapping consistency to lift the burden of establishing spatial correspondence; achieved ~15% improvement than the strongest baseline with higher temporal consistency.
	* **Video Harmonization Dataset Construction**: Released the first public, large-scale, and high-quality video harmonization dataset [HYouTube](https://github.com/bcmi/Video-Harmonization-Dataset-HYouTube) which contains 3194 pairs of synthetic composite videos and real videos. 
	* **Background-Guided Image Harmonization [[code](https://github.com/bcmi/BargainNet)]**: Reformulated image harmonization as background-guided domain translation to explicitly utilize background domain to guide the foreground harmonization; enabled inharmony level assessment of composite images; achieved new state-of-the-art: ~20% improvements than the strongest baseline.
	* **Image Harmonization via Domain Verification [[code](https://github.com/bcmi/Image_Harmonization_Datasets)]**: Proposed novel domain verification discriminator to pull close the foreground domain and background domain; achieved state-of-the-art performance: ~30% improvements than the strongest baseline; provided the first benchmark in image harmonization field.
	* **Image Harmonization Dataset Construction**: Released the first large-scale image harmonization dataset [iHarmony4](https://github.com/bcmi/Image_Harmonization_Datasets) with 4 sub-datasets (HCOCO, HAdobe5k, HFlickr, and Hday2night) and 73146 pairs of high-quality images.
